A Riverious Tale | 250 x 250 map, 50% world size, Slate & Marble, Temperate Forest 

Mods: All mods can be safely removed

Note: The map is created 100% from scratch, in the timelapse you can see the starter map is flat without terrain, just dirt and animals. No plants as well. It was honestly fun, creating something from nothing and just figuring it out as i went.
